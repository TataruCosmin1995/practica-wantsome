    <p>The United States is as vast as it is exciting! Stretching for thousands of miles, it literally takes days (non-stop) to drive from one end to the other which is no mean feat, especially if you’re the designated driver.</p>
    <p>Our last road trip from the Florida Keys to Los Angeles took approximately 50 hours of solid driving; thankfully, there’s no need to do this in one fell swoop. There are tonnes of incredible places to stop, chill out and explore on your route.
    
        Whether you decide to travel east to west, north or south or up and down, there are a mind-boggling array of cool, delicious and quirky places you’ve gotta visit along your way.</p>
